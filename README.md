# This is a project to play Singapore Mahjong over a web browser with friends and strangers alike!


- We noticed that while there are many apps to play PVP (player-versus-player) Hong Kong/Taiwanese style Mahjong, there isn't for Singaporean Mahjong. So we created our own!
- This application is built with Node and Express, with SocketIO.
- To try this web application, you can open 4 tabs and enter into the [website](https://sgmahjong.onrender.com/). Enter the same room and you can start playing!

## Features
- Real time updating of tiles against other players
- Automatic chip calculation, for both "Shooter pay" and "All pay" playstyles
- Differing game speeds

You can visit our [website](https://sgmahjong.onrender.com/) to try it out!
